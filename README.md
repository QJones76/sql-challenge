# sql-challenge
---
In this challenge, I took csv files containing fictional employee data, mapped out an entity relationship diagram (ERD) using [Quick DBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/), imported the datasets into a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, and performed some exploratory queries on the database. 

## Usage
--- 
The "data" folder contains all of the datasets I used in this challenge in csv format. The "ERD" folder contains an image of my entity relationship diagram (ERD) for this database. Finally, the SQL_files contains the database schemata and all the exploratory queries I ran. The sub-folder named "all_queries_split_files" just breaks down the "all_queries.sql" file into each individual query I ran on the database by placing each query into separate .sql files. It should be noted that each exploratory question I answered is in comments at the beginning of an individual query. Thus, every .sql file in this repository, except for "table_schemata.sql", should contain a comment containing the question I was looking to answer before the query appears.
